## overview

Git Branching assignment

### completed sections

I completed all four sections in the introduction sequence
1. Intro to Git Commits
2. Branching in Git
3. Merging in Git
4. Rebase Intro

### commits

A commit records a snapshot of all tracked files in a directory (kind of like copy and paste)

### git branching

A git branch points to a certain commit

### merging in git

Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unique parents. Basically, combining multiple "branches."

### rebase

Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else. This allows you to have a uniform and linear set of commits and makes everything cleaner.
